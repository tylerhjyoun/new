# Getting Started

You'll need to install the following modules in mern-egg:
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv
This is mostly for middle ware and database integration into the front end

and

sudo npm install -g nodemon
This lets us look into our server in real time, so the page knows to refresh everytime a change is introduced to the code
(sudo just gives superuser permission to install this, since it's gonna be installed globally)


# To run the server
In the backend dir,
nodemon server 

# To start the frontend
in mern-egg, 
npm start
