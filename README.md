# Getting Started
You'll need to install the following modules: npm install express cors mongoose dotenv This is mostly for middle ware and database integration into the front end

and

sudo npm install -g nodemon This lets us look into our server in real time, so the page knows to refresh everytime a change is introduced to the code (sudo just gives superuser permission to install this, since it's gonna be installed globally)

and

npm install bootstrap

make sure its v4.0+
# To run the server
cd backend nodemon server

# To start the frontend
Begin in the git repo

npm start
