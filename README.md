# Getting Started
You'll need to install all of the modules

use npm install in all folders with package.json file

sudo npm install -g nodemon This lets us look into our server in real time, so the page knows to refresh everytime a change is introduced to the code (sudo just gives superuser permission to install this, since it's gonna be installed globally)

make sure its v4.0+
# To run the server
cd backend
nodemon server

# To start the frontend
Begin in the git repo

npm start
